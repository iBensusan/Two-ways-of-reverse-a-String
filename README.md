# Two Algorithms to Reverse a String

This program allows users to enter a sentence and choose between two methods to reverse the string: using a for loop or using string slicing. It's a simple project focused on working with strings, loops, and basic functions in Python.

## Project Level: Beginner

This project is designed for beginner learners who are still learning and practicing Python fundamentals.

## How the Project Works

The program starts by prompting the user to input a sentence and choose a method for reversing it. It then:

1. Reverses the string using a for loop, iterating through each character and building the reversed string.
2. Alternatively, reverses the string using Python's slicing method for a more concise approach.
3. Displays the reversed string based on the selected method.

If an invalid method is chosen, the program will prompt the user to select a valid option.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `reverse_string.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. This code works with Python 3.x.

## Usage

Run the program and follow the prompts:

1. Enter the sentence you want to reverse.
2. Choose the method for reversing the string:
   - Type `for` to reverse using a for loop.
   - Type `slicing` to reverse using the slicing method.
3. The program will display the reversed string based on your selected method.
